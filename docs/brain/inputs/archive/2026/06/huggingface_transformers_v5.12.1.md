*Summary from release notes:*

# Patch release v5.12.1
Updated the lower bound for PEFT and a fix for auto tokenizer to properly resolve the mistral tokenizer (when `mistral-common` is installed). This is similar to v.5.10.3 minus the fixes that were already included in the main release - vLLM will first target 5.10.3 :hugs: 

* Fix `peft` lower bound #46605 by @hmellor (#46605)
* mistral common backend fix #46667 by @itazap (#46667)
